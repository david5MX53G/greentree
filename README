Greentree is a distributed, pseudonymous transaction system facilitating secure,
 private transactions between mutually-unknown parties via token-based 
identities on a token-controlled audit log that provides both privacy and trust 
to system users.

This project was started in Spring, 2018 for the MSSE_670 Java Programming class
 from Regis University. 

These are the root-level files:

These are the root-level directories:
* "test" - Java classes for JUnit unit testing
* "src" - Java class files
* "nbproject" - auto-generated NetBeans project files
* "lib" - necessary libraries for the compile CLASSPATH
* "docs" - MS Word docs required by Regis University and UML diagrams
* "config" - controls project logging and token file storage
