- The "config/application.properties" file contains the configuration information required by the application.
- Unit testing has been performed and documented in "docs/HWUnitTestExecution.doc".
- "manifest.txt" in the project root identifies the method "public static void main(String[] args)" using the Main-Class directive.
- The jar file "greentree.jar" was built using "set_ant.cmd", Apache Ant, and the "build.xml" file as described in "docs/HWUnitTestExecution.doc".
- "config/application.properties" must be in the same working directory as greentree.jar for the application to function.
- Updated UML class diagrams are now in "docs/HWDesign.doc" which describe the application model.
